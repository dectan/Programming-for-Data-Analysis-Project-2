# Introduction #

<p>This repository is used for the project given during the Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2 module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from ATU.</p>

<p>For this module I created one notebook called Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2.</p>

<p>
The layout of this project is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li> 1. What is Palaeoclimatology, </li>
<li> 2. Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs – present. </li>
<li> 3. Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage) </li>
<li> 4. Examine Irish context: </li>
<li> 5. Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats  </li> 
<li> 6. For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).  </li> 
<li> 7. Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue   </li>
<li> 8. Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-icecoverage) </li>
<li> 9. Conclusion </li>
</ol>

# How to run program #
<ol>
<li> Install Anaconda </li>
<li> Install Visual Studio Code </li>   
<li> Clone repository </li> 
<li> Open repository in Visual Studio Code </li>
</ol>

# Additional Information #
<ol>
<li> My github repository is @ <a href="#">https://github.com/dectan/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2</a></li>
<li> My github Repository is called "Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2</li>
<li> This repository contains a .gitignore file, 1 *  Jupyter notebook named 'Project 2.ipynb', and a README file, a folder called 'imported_datasets' which contains all imported datasets, a folder called 'fused datasets' which contains all fused datasets and a folder called 'img which contains images. </li>    
<li> These are all the additional files required to run program </li>
<li> images are stored in a folder called "img" in this repository </li>
<li> Libraries that need to be imported are contained in first *text* cell of both Jupyter notebooks </li> 
</ol>

# Imported Libraries #
<ol>
<li>import numpy as np</li>
<p> NumPy is short for "Numerical Python". It allows for matematical and logical operations on arrays efficiently. NumPy also enables user to reshape,slice ,stack and join arrays.</p>
<li>import pandas as pd</li>
<p>Pandas is an open source Python library that provides high performance data manipulation tools and analysis tools. It also allows for reading and writing from various file formats, such as .csv. Pandas has functions for analyzing, cleaning , exploring and manipulating data</p>
<li>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</li>
<p>Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python. It is open source. Using Mathplotlib, different types of plots can be created, such as scatter plots, histograms,box plots etc.</p>
<li>import seaborn as sns</li>
<p>Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.It is designed to work well with dataframes from Pandas</p>
<li>from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression</li>
<p>LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, …, wp) to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.[23] *sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression*, scikit-learn, https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html</p>
<li>from scipy.fft import fft, fftfreq</li>
<p>Return the Discrete Fourier Transform sample frequencies.</p>
<li>from scipy import signal</li>
<p>to modify, analyze and process the signal [24] *Scipy Signal – Helpful Tutorial*, pythonguides, https://pythonguides.com/scipy-signal/</p> 
<li>import json</li>
<p> JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation) is a file that is mainly used to store and transfer data mostly between a server and a web application. It is popularly used for representing structured data.</p>
