# Introduction #

<p>This repository is used for the project given during the Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2 module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from ATU.</p>

<p>For this module I created one notebook called Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2.</p>

# How to run program #
<ol>
<li> Install Anaconda </li>
<li> Install Visual Studio Code </li>   
<li> Clone repository </li> 
<li> Open repository in Visual Studio Code </li>
</ol>

# Additional Information #
<ol>
<li> My github repository is @ <a href="#"></a></li>
<li> My github Repository is called "Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2</li>
<li> This repository contains a .gitignore file, 1 *  Jupyter notebook, and a readme file and a folder with images. </li>   
<li> My Jupyter notebooks are called "ipynb"</li> 
<li> There are no additional files required to run program as dataset is loaded from seaborn </li>
<li> images are stored in a folder called "img" in this repository </li>
<li> Libraries that need to be imported are contained in first *text* cell of both Jupyter notebooks </li> 
</ol>

# Imported Libraries #
<ol>
<li>import numpy as np</li>
<p> NumPy is short for "Numerical Python". It allows for matematical and logical operations on arrays efficiently. NumPy also enables user to reshape,slice ,stack and join arrays.</p>
<li>import pandas as pd</li>
<p>Pandas is an open source Python library that provides high performance data manipulation tools and analysis tools. It also allows for reading and writing from various file formats, such as .csv. Pandas has functions for analyzing, cleaning , exploring and manipulating data</p>
<li>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</li>
<p>Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python. It is open source. Using Mathplotlib, different types of plots can be created, such as scatter plots, histograms,box plots etc.</p>
<li>import seaborn as sns</li>
<p>Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.It is designed to work well with dataframes from Pandas
